                                Since its inception in 1991, Interport Global Logistics aimed high and today, it stands as an international logistics company that has grown leaps and bounds to be among the top companies in India. Mr. Sham Bendre, the Chairman of IGL (Interport Global Logistics) established the company, and he holds his position over the international logistics company even today.

                                IGL initially began as a local packers and movers business entity that provided logistics transportation services. However, the shipping logistics company’s services soon expanded to include extended services such as Warehousing, Custom Broking, International Forwarding, Project Cargo Handling, NVOCC, 3PL logistics, Export/Import consolidation, air cargo and International and Domestic Relocation services.

                                The company has executed its venture by establishing its branches in major Indian cities and ports, with its Mumbai office being its main headquarters. These logistics solutions branch offices were also what gave IGL its access to major international ports. Thus, due to its strategic location of branches, IGL has the ability to offer its customers warehousing facilities and transport equipment to handle any kind of cargo independently. This, in turn, has helped establish the company’s reputation as one of the top relocation companies in India. And, IGL is determined to keep it that way and retain the trust and goodwill of both their old and new customers alike.

                                Additionally, in May 2000, as a means of furthering its stance in the list of top freight logistics companies in India, IGL acquired a freight forwarding NVOCC Company. And now, IGL is a registered Multimodal Transport Operator, operating under own Bill of Lading, IATA, and Custom House Clearing Agent. IGL Bill of Lading is insured with the British Marine Luxembourg SA Marine & Transport Intermodal Cover. IGL is also accredited with the prestigious ISO 9000:2000, ISO 14001:2004, and ISO 18000:2007 Certification.
