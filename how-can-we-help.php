                            People are the very heart of our enterprise – both inside and outside the company. For, while we owe our smooth running and steady quality rating to our team of employees and colleagues within Interport, our customers’ trust and partnership with us has ensured our reputation and success outside the company walls. Hence, maintaining a positive and trustworthy relationship with people and the community as a whole forms the very basis of our logistics services company’s core principles.
                            </p>
                            <p class="mb-0">
                            Consequently, respect and trust are of high priority at Interport Global Logistics (IGL). As is executing and delivering a high quality of service to our clients. And it is the combination of these principle guidelines that has led IGL to currently hold a place among the best logistics companies in the country.
